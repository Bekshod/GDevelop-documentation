# GDevelop for Education

GDevelop is widely used in schools, universities and boot camps. To ease the experience of teachers and accounts, an Education plan has been created.

## Teaching resources

The Education plan gives access to teachers to a curriculum designed by the GDevelop team. This curriculum is intended to teachers as a means to teach game development.

It includes multiple ready-to-teach lessons that cover game development theory and step-by-step practical lessons to create full games.

## Education plan setup

The Education plan is purchased with at least 5 seats. A seat is either occupied by a teacher account, or a student account.

For instance with 10 seats you can have:

- 1 teacher account;
- 9 student accounts.

**All accounts benefits from the same perks as a Gold subscription** (see details [here](https://gdevelop.io/pricing)). This includes the possibility for students to work with Android or iPad tablets with the native app.

## Teacher accounts specificities

Besides teaching resources, teacher accounts gain access to the Classrooms tab on GDevelop's homepage.

In this tab, they can view all the student accounts linked to the plan. The student accounts can be sorted into Rooms for a better organization between teachers.

A teacher can also see the projects of each student and open them in a read-only mode so that they can:

- Control the work done on the projects;
- Preview the game to ensure the logic works.

## Student accounts specificities

Student accounts are anonymized. The credentials for those accounts (disposable email address + password) are accessible to teachers.

!!! tip

    If you have specific needs related to how students should access their accounts (reuse existing emails, SSO, etc...), please reach out to us.

Some concepts in GDevelop's editor have been hidden to student accounts so that they can focus on their work in class:

- Premium products;
- Credits;
- Social networks mentions;
- Announcements and ads;
- GDevelop gaming page.

Student accounts also have access to the version history feature for Cloud projects: they can go back to any previous save they made.
