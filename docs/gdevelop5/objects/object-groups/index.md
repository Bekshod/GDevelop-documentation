# Object groups

You can organize objects into _groups_ and then refer to all of the objects in that group by a single name.

This makes it possible to create events that applies to lots of objects without repeating events multiple times, increasing performance of your game, maintainability, and readability of your events.


## Create a group of objects

To organize objects into groups:

1. In the toolbar, select the **Groups** icon.
2. Click on **Add a new group**.
4. In the **Create a new group** dialog, select the objects to add the group.
5. Click on **Create** when you're done.

## Add variables to an object group

Variables are added to groups using the same editor as [Object variables](/gdevelop5/all-features/variables/object-variables).

!!! tip

    For more information, refer to [Object variables](/gdevelop5/all-features/variables/object-variables).

### Change variable values for one object only

When you add variables to a group, they are duplicated on every object of the group. It means that you can edit the objects to set a different value for them. After modifying variables values on the object, you will see **Mixed values** in place of the value in the group editor.
